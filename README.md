### 📋 Briefing
_young-grasshopper v1_ was not user friendly and prospective students didn't use it. As a result, I decided to gamify it by building a text-based game, inspired by Oregon Trail, that would simulate going to university in the United States. Storyboarded in **Miro**, the game would have a public & private university options; three career tracks and fifteen degrees for each based off Massachusetts top university programs. Built with players and admins in mind, users would be able to _attend_ four years of university and receive a scorecard on acquired debt and estimated years to pay off debt based on their interest rate. Meanwhile, admins would be able to add degrees, courses, and mini-games to simulate working part-time & full-time while going to university.

### 📋 Briefing
The yearly costs associated with pursuing a higher education seem to increase every year by a rate that surpasses even the rate of inflation. Yet, prospective students are provided with little insight into the financial debt that their degree choices make on them post-graduation. As a result, a single-page web app was built to set expectations for students on what they would be making post-graduation and how much they could save by working while going to school. Users were also taught how to research their expected salary using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website.
