Due to the yearly increasing costs associated with pursuing a higher education, along with little comprehensive content around the costs of college or university the following webpages were created. HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used to build local webpages to provide High School students with informational content around the hidden costs associated with going to university in the U.S. A detailed workflow was also outlined on the second webpage to provide high school students with a deeper understanding of how much a specific occupation could earn them based on the closest Metropolitan estimates from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website.

## Features Built into Workflow
1. Dynamic calculators were created to estimate the costs of college/university tuition, the total cost of a bank loan based on the estimated interest, and the amount of earnings the high school student could earn if they worked throughout a portion of their college education.
2. Occupation projected income workflow was created using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website to provide students with clarity on how much their earnings could be, along with the projected market growth for that position in the next few years.
3. Button's were created to hide and reveal relevant content based on the users interests.
