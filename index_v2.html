                                Prior to providing you with a loan to pay for your tuition, banks use your families credit score and your own

                                I know! It's crazy that the state of the economy will impact your loan rate. That's why some families
                                elect to select a fixed rate so that they aren't caught by surprise by changing monthly payments. 
                                Fixed interest rates impact monthly payments by making them unchanged over time. Meaning that your
